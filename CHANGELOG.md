All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.0.0-beta.1] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- `rk run --resume` on terminal runs now returns a clear, actionable error instead of
  "not yet implemented". Affected halt_reason values: `epic_completed`, `no_runnable_sprint`,
  `config_error`, `epic_not_found`, `path_conflict`, `user_abort`.
- `rk review-verdict <id> rejected` now surfaces a warning to stderr and provides manual
  resolution instructions when the auto-revert encounters a merge conflict. Previously the
  conflict was silently swallowed, leaving the working tree dirty and sprint status unchanged.
  On conflict, `git revert --abort` is called automatically so the working tree is left clean.

### Added

- Coverage reporting via `vitest --coverage` (`test:coverage` script in both packages).
- `@vitest/coverage-v8` devDependency; produces `text` + `lcov` reports under `coverage/`.
- npm publish workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) triggered on `v*` tags.

### Chores

- Version bumped from `0.1.0-alpha.1` to `1.0.0-beta.1`.
